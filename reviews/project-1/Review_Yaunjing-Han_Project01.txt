PROBLEM 1:

Part A:
  I see that you are using 'grep -oE '\w{{2,}}' to run your searches as we did in homeworks and class exercises.
  But running this way could lead to errors. What "grep -oE '\w{{2,}}'" does, is it first searches for ALL 2 letter words in the file.
  You are then running your search on "JO" or "Beth" or "Meg" from that list of 2 letter words.
  Instead of running it in this way you can search for the word directly using the grep command. (Ex: grep -w -i -oE 'Jo')


Part B:
  I learned a very neat way of going about this problem from your code. I was using the cat function and then using grep to search that text.
  It's good to know another way to approach the problem.


PROBLEM 2:

Part A:
  I did not think of solving the problem the way you did. Your approach was very nice and efficient. Sorting the list of starting / ending stations and
  then piping it to get the unique counts and further sorting the count in reverse order. I really found this an interesting way!


Part B:
  Once again, it is great to see the way you approached the problem. I most certainly did not think of running it this way. Your approach is very interesting.
  I keep seeing that you run two commands: "sort -rn | head -10", instead you could finish that in one by simply running "tail-10"



PROBLEM 3:
  It is interesting to see that you were able to run your filters successfully and got the same output as shell commands. I was having a very difficult time with filters.
  I am still trying to understand filters, so I don't want to take a dab at your code, because I do not fully understand it myself.
