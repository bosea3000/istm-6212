PROBLEM 1:

Part A:
  Although, this is not the way I ran my code, this is a very neat of going about it. However, your grep command seems to first search for
  all the words 1 letter or more and then searches that list for the desired words. You can directly search for the words using:
  (Ex: grep -w -i -oE 'Jo')

Part B:
  Different from how I ran but we ended up with the same results. However, your command is redundant and you do not need the following:
  " grep -oE '\w{{3,}}'| sort | uniq -c | sort -rn ". Simply searching for Rom. or Jul. and counting would yeild the same results.


PROBLEM 2:

Part A:
  I did not think of solving the problem the way you did. Your approach was very nice and efficient. Sorting the list of starting / ending stations and
  then piping it to get the unique counts and further sorting the count in reverse order. I really found this an interesting way!

  But rather than having two commands "sort -rn | head -10", you can use one "tail -10"

Part B:
  Once again, it is great to see the way you approached the problem. I most certainly did not think of running it this way. Your approach is very interesting.
  Again, I keep seeing that you run two commands: "sort -rn | head -10", instead you could finish that in one by simply running "tail-10"


PROBLEM 3:
  Good job on the filter problem! I could not get mine to work, I need to understand the coding behind the filter. I am glad to see your method of solving this.
  I really would need to understand the filter concept before I make any comments on your code.
